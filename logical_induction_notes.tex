This paper has devised a principled way of assigning probabilities to logical statements prior to them being deductively proved or refuted, which satisfies many desirable properties. This is motivated by how proofs of important lemmata in mathematics should update our credences about unproved theorems. By recasting probabilities as prices in an appropriate stock market, this paper shows a weakening of the Dutch Book theorem by relating irrationality with market exploitation.
